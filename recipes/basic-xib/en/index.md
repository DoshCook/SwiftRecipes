Let's place a UILabel on the XIB and display "Hello Wolrd!"

## Introduction

Project creation is based on the following.
[Create a project, Application development using XIB.](https://swift-recipes.doshcook.com/recipes/create-project)

## Sample

Here is a sample.üëâ[DoshCook/SwiftRecipesSample](https://github.com/DoshCook/SwiftRecipesSample/pull/7)

## Placement in XIB

First, let's place the label on the XIB.

1. Open the .xib file of the screen you want to place and select the + button (Figure 1).

    ![Figure 1](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure1.png)
    *Figure 1*

2. Select the UILabel and drag and drop it onto the screen. (Figure 2 -> Figure 3)
      
    ![Figure 2](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure2.png)
    *Figure 2*
    ![Figure 3](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure3.png)
    *Figure 3*

3. Set the AutoLayout setting.
   
    Use AutoLayout to specify the location of the label. This time we will place it in the center of the screen.
    With the label you want to layout selected, select the `Align` icon at the bottom of the screen.

    Check the `Horizontally in Container` and `Vertically in Container` boxes and select `Add Constraints`. (Figure 4)

    ![Figure 4](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure4.png)
    *Figure 4*

    <details><summary>How to check the AutoLayout that is currently attached</summary>
    To check the AutoLayout you have attached, select the line on the screen, or go to `Constraints` in the hierarchy.

4. Let's change the label text to "Hello World!".
   
   Select the `Show the Attributes inspector` icon on the right side of the screen and change the text of the label.

    ![Figure 5](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure5.png)
    *Figure 5*

Now that the labels are in place.
Let's run it and check it out.

## Connect to code

Next, let's tie the UILabel placed in xib to the code. In this case, we'll name it `titleLabel`.

1. Select `Add Editor on Right`. (Figure 7)
   
    ![Figure 7](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure7.png)
    *Figure 7*

    Since the screen will be split, let's display the code on one side since it will be split (Figure 8).

    ![Figure 8](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure8.png)
    *Figure 8*

    <details><summary>How to open a file in split-screen mode.</summary>
    When the screen is split, the file will be opened on the screen that has the focus.
    If you want to place it on the right side of the screen, click on the right side and then select the file you want to open.

    You can also hold down `option` while selecting to open the file on the other side of the focused screen.
    </details>

2. While holding down the Control button, drag from the label to be connected to the cord. (Figure 9)
   
    ![Figure 9](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure9.png)
    *Figure 9*

3. Give it a name and select `connect`. (Figure 10)
   
    ![Figure 10](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure10.png)
    *Figure 10*

This completes the connection with the code.

<details><summary>Wrong name! To reconfigure</summary>
If you have made a mistake in the name of the label, you will need to reconfigure it.
If you change only the name of the code directly, you will get the following error, and it will crash.

> *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<SwiftRecipesSample.BasicLabelViewController 0x7fe755a09160> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key titleLabel.'
> terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException

In such a case, it is necessary to unlink them on XIB.
Open the .xib file, select `File's Owner`, press the `Show the Connections inspector` icon on the right side, and press X to remove the Outlets ‚ö†Ô∏è.

Then, please follow the above steps again to connect.

It can also be connected by pulling from the code side. (From the figure below).

## Let's set up multiple labels.

Let's place the second label. The next label will be named `descriptionLabel`. This will be placed 8px below the `titleLabel`.

1. Place to XIB
   
    Follow the same steps as the first one to place it in the XIB. Drag and drop it roughly where you want to place it. (Figure 11)

    ![Figure 11](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure11.png)
    *Figure 11*

2. Add a vertical constraint.
   
    Next, press the `Add New Constraints` icon at the bottom of the screen to configure the AutoLayout settings. Since we want to place it 8px below the `titleLabel`, we will add the upper constraint as shown in Figure 12.

    ![Figure 12](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure12.png)
    *Figure 12*

    When adding constraints, make sure you select the target view.(Figure 13)

    ![Figure 13](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure13.png)
    *Figure 13*

3. Add a horizontal constraint.
   
    Finally, let's add a horizontal constraint.
    You can set the margins on the left and right sides of the screen in Figure 12, but this time we will specify the center of the screen.

    Check the `Horizontally in Continer` checkbox from the `Align` icon. (Figure 14)

    ![Figure 14](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure14.png)
    *Figure 14*

This completes the placement of the second label.
If you don't need to configure on the code, you don't need to connect it.

## Adjusting the layout

First, let's increase the font size of the `titleLabel`.

Select "Hello World" on the XIB, and change the font from the `Show the Attributes inspector` icon. (Figure 15)

![Figure 15](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure15.png)
*Figure 15*

We also changed the text of the `descriptionLabel` to "Have fun with Swift!".

Finally, let's shift it slightly upward from the center of the screen. Select the horizontal line of the `titleLabel` and change the `Constant` from the `Show the Attributes inspector` icon on the right of the screen. (Figure 16)

![Figure 16](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure16.png)
*Figure 16*

## Connect multiple labels as an array

When connecting to the code, you can also put multiple labels together into an array.

1. Prepare an array with `IBOutlet` in the code as shown below.
   
    ```swift
    @IBOutlet private var labels: [UILabel] = []
   ```

2. Connect it to the label you want to put in the array. (Figure 17)

    ![Figure 17](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure17.png)
    *Figure 17*

3. Check it is added to the `Outlet Collections` of XIB. (Figure 18)

    ![Figure 18](/assets/basic-xib/images/figure18.png)
    *Figure 18*

4. Let's change the color of the labels together in the code.

    Use forEach to change the color of the labels all at once.

    ```swift
    @IBOutlet private var labels: [UILabel] = []

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Change the color of labels at once.
        labels.forEach {
            $0.textColor = .systemBlue
        }
    }
    ```

This completes the purpose of this recipe.

## Conclusion

These are the basics of how to place components using XIB.
If you use Storyboard, you can use Interface Builder to connect to the code in the same way.

The usage for each component will be added in the future.
